# Exercise 3.25: Factorial

- a) Write a program that reads a nonnegative integer and computes and prints its factorial. [C++ Program File a)](p03_25a.cpp)

- b) Write a program that estimates the value of the mathematical constant e by using the formula: [C++ Program File b)](p03_25b.cpp)

$$e = 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3!...$$

- c) Write a program that computes the value of exby using the formula [C++ Program File c)](p03_25c.cpp)

$$e^x = 1 + x/1! + x^1/2! + X^2/3!...$$
