# Exercise 3.22: Identify the Error

**Whatâ€™s wrong with the following statement? Provide a correct single statement to accomplish what the programmer was probably trying to do.**

```cpp
    cout << ++(x + y);
```

There are two things that the programmer might want to do, that is:

maybe he wanted to pre increment both `x` and `y` and then add it together, `(x + y)`.

```cpp
cout << ++x + ++y;
```

or he might have wanted to increment to 1 after adding `x` and `y`.

```cpp
cout << (x + y) = 1;
```
