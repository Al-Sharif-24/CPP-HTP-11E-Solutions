# Exercise 3.4: Credit Limits

**Develop a C++ program to determine whether a clothing-store customer has exceeded the credit limit on a charge account. For each customer, the following facts are available:**
- a) **Account number (an integer)**
- b) **Balance at the beginning of the month**
- c) **Total of all items charged by this customer this month**
- d) **Total of all credits applied to this customer's account this month**
- e) **Allowed credit limit**
**The program should use a `while` statement to input each of these facts, calculate then newbalance (= beginning balance + charges – credits) and determine whether the newbalance exceeds the customer’s credit limit. For those customers whose credit limit is exceeded, the program should display the customer’s account number, credit limit, newbalance and the message “Credit Limit Exceeded.”**

## Problem Statement
```txt
Check whether a customer has exceeded the credit limit on an account
```

## First Step Refinement
```txt
Initialise the variables
Input the values
Print the account details and if credit exceeded
```

## Second Step Refinement
```txt
Initialise accountNum variable to 0
Initialise beginB variable to 0
Initialise totalCharges variable to 0
Initialise totalCredit variable to 0
Initialise creditLimit variable to 0 
Initialise newB variable to 0 

Ask for input from the user about account number
Input account number and store it in accoutNum

while the accoutnum value is not a sentiel value:
    Ask for input from user about beginning balance
    Input the beginning balance and store it in beginB

    Ask for input from user about total charges
    Input the total charges and store it in totalCharges

    Ask for input from user about total credits
    Input the total credits and store it in totalCredits

    Ask for input from user about credit limit
    Input the credit limit and store it in creditLimit

    Calculate the new balance
    Print the new balance

    if new balance is greater than beginning balance:
        print the account number
        print the credit limit
        print the balance
        print "Credit Limit Exceeded"

    Ask for input from the user about account number
    Input account number and store it in accoutNum

```
