# Exercise 3.15: Another Dangling else problem

**modify the following code to produce the output shown. Use proper indentation techniques. You must not make any additional changes other than inserting braces.**

- a) Assuming x = 5 and y = 8, the following output is produced
```txt
    @@@@@
    $$$$$
    &&&&&
```
no modification is needed

- b) Assuming x = 5 and y = 8, the following output is produced.
```txt
    @@@@@
```
```cpp
if ( y == 8 )
if ( x == 5 )
cout << "@@@@@\n";
else {
cout << "#####\n";
cout << "$$$$$\n";
cout << "&&&&&\n";
} 
```

- c) Assuming x = 5 and y = 8, the following output is produced
```txt
    @@@@@
    &&&&&
```
```cpp
if ( y == 8 )
if ( x == 5 )
cout << "@@@@@\n";
else {
cout << "#####\n";
cout << "$$$$$\n";
}
cout << "&&&&&\n"; 
```

- d) Assuming x = 5 and y = 7, the following output is produced
```txt
    #####
    $$$$$
    &&&&&
```
```cpp
if ( y == 8 )
if ( x == 5 )
cout << "@@@@@\n";
else {}
cout << "#####\n";
cout << "$$$$$\n";
cout << "&&&&&\n"; 

```
