# Exercise 3.3: Gas Mileage

**Drivers are concerned with the mileage obtained by their automobiles. One driver has kept track of several trips by recording miles driven and gallons used for each trip. Develop a C++ program that uses a `while` statement to input the miles driven and gallons used for each trip. The program should calculate and display the miles per gallon obtained for each trip and print the combined miles per gallon obtained for all tankfuls up to this point**

## Problem Statement
```txt
Calculate the miles per gallon for each trip and also the miles per gallon of the tank upto that trip
```

## First Step Refinement
```txt
Initialise the variables
Input the values
Print the miles per gallon
```

## Second Step Refinement
```txt
Initialise miles variable to 0
Initialise gallon variable to 0
Initialsie totalmiles variable to 0
Initialise totalgallons variable to 0 

Ask for input from the user about miles driven
Input miles driven and store it in miles

while the miles value is not a sentiel value:
    Ask for input from user about gallons used
    Input the gallons used and store it in gallon

    Calculate the miles per gallons used for that trip
    Print the MPG

    Add the miles for this trip in the totalmiles
    Add the gallons for this trip in the totalmiles
    Calculate the average MPG for all the trips
    Print the average MPG

    Ask for input from the user about miles driven
    Input miles driven and store it in miles

```
