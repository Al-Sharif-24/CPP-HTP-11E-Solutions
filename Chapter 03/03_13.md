# Exercise 3.13: Dangling-else problem

**Add braces to the preceding code snippet to force the nested ifâ€¦else statement to execute as originally intended**

```cpp
    if (x > 5)
        if (y > 5) 
            cout << "x and y are > 5";
        else 
            cout << "x is <= 5";

```
```cpp
    if (x > 5) {
        if (y > 5) 
            cout << "x and y are > 5";
    } else 
        cout << "x is <= 5";

```
