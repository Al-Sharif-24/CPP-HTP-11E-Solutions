# Exercise 3.6: Salary Calculator

**Develop a C++ program that uses a `while` statement to determine the gross pay for each of several employees. The company pays “straight time” for the first 40 hours worked by each employee and pays “time-and-a-half” for all hours worked over 40 hours. You are given a list of the employees of the company, the number of hours each employee worked last week and the hourly rate of each employee. Your program should input this information for each employee and should determine and display the employee’s gross pay.**

## Problem Statement
```txt
Determine the salary of an employee based on the number of hours worked
```

## First Step Refinement
```txt
Initialise the variables
Input the values
Print the earning based on number of hours
```

## Second Step Refinement
```txt
Initialise hoursWorked variable to 0
Initialise hourlyRate variable to 0
Initialise salary variable to 0

Ask for input from the user about hours worked
Input hours worked and store it in hoursWorked

while the hoursWorked is not a sentiel value:
    Initialse additionalsalary variable to 0
    
    Ask for input from the user about hourly rate
    Input hourly rate and store it in hourlyRate

    Calculate the salary
    Print the salary

    Ask for input from the user about sales
    Input sales and store it in sales
```
