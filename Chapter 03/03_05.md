# Exercise 3.5: Sales-Commission Calculator

**A large company pays its salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople each receive $200 per week plus 9% of their weekly gross sales. For example, a salesperson who sells $5000 worth of chemicals receives $200 plus 9% of $5000 for a total of $650. Develop a C++ program that uses a `while` statement to input each salesperson’s gross sales for last week and calculates and displays that salesperson’s earnings. Process one salesperson’s figures at a time.**

## Problem Statement
```txt
Check and display a salesperson's gross earning per week
```

## First Step Refinement
```txt
Initialise the variables
Input the values
Print the earning based on weekly gross sales
```

## Second Step Refinement
```txt
Initialise sales variable to 0
Initialise beginB variable to 0
Initialise salary variable to 0

Ask for input from the user about sales
Input sales and store it in sales

while the sales is not a sentiel value:
    
    Calculate the salary
    Print the salary

    Ask for input from the user about sales
    Input sales and store it in sales
```
