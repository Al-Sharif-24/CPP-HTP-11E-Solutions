# Exercise 3.10: Validating User Input

**The examination results program given below assumes that any value input by the user that’s not a 1 must be a 2. Modify the application to validate its inputs. If a value entered is not 1 or 2, keep looping until the user enters a correct value**

```txt
initialize passes to zero
initialize failures to zero
initialize student counter to one
while student counter is less than or equal to 10
    prompt the user to enter the next exam result
    input the next exam result

    if the student passed
        add one to passes
    else
        add one to failures

    add one to student counter

print the number of passes
print the number of failures

if more than eight students passed
    print “Bonus to instructor!”
```
```cpp
if(result == 1) {
    passes = passes + 1;
} else if (result == 2) {
    failures = failures + 1;
} else {
    cout << "Invalid grade";
    studentsCounter--;
}
```
