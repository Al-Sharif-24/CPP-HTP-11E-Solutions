# Exercise 3.2: What Does This Program Do?

**What does the following program print**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x{1};
    int total{0};

    while (x <= 10) {
        int y = x * x;
        cout << y << "\n";
        total += y;
        ++x;
    }

    cout << "Total is " << total << "\n";
} 
```

This program prints the square of numbers from 1 to 10 and also prints the sum of them.
