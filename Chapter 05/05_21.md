# Exercsie 5.21: Coin Tossing

**Write a program that simulates coin tossing. For each coin toss, the program should print `Heads` or `Tails`. Let the program toss the coin 100 times and count the number of times each side of the coin appears. Print the results. The program should call a separate function flip that takes no arguments and returns 0 for tails and 1 for heads**
