# Solutions to Exercise 5.5 (Short-Answer Questions)

## a)

-   Every number has an equal chance of being chosen at any time.

## b)

-   Because it produces a series of pseudo-random numbers.

## c)

-   If the program have simulation of random selection, it will be desirable not to randomize when testing the program. This is because the output will be different each time the program is run, and it will be difficult to verify the correctness of the program.

## d)

-   It enables more accurate predictions of random events, such as cars arriving at toll
    booths and people arriving in lines at a supermarket. The results of a simulation can
    help determine how many toll booths to have open or how many cashiers to have
    open at specified times.
