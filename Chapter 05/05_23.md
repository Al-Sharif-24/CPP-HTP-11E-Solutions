# Exercise 5.23: Guess-the-Number Game Modification

**Modify the program of Exercise 5.22 to count the number of guesses the player makes. If the number is 10 or fewer, print `"Either you know the secret or you got lucky!"` If the player guesses the number in 10 tries, print `"Ahah! You know the secret!"` If the player makes more than 10 guesses, print `"You should be able to do better!"` Why should it take no more than 10 guesses? Well, with each “good guess,” the player should be able to eliminate half of the numbers. Now show why any number from 1 to 1000 can be guessed in 10 or fewer tries.**

Any Number from 1 to 1000, with a good guess can be guessed in 10 or fewer tries, if we guess it in terms of binary search algorithm. The binary search algorithm reduces the cases with 1/2 as it goes on, thereby for a 1000cases, it'll take 10 tries.
