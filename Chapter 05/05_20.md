# Exercise 5.20: Quality Points for Numeric Grades

**Write a function `qualityPoints` that inputs a student’s average and returns 4 if a student’s average is 90–100, 3 if the average is 80–89, 2 if the average is 70–79, 1 if the average is 60–69 and 0 if the average is lower than 60.**

```cpp
    int qualityPoints(int average) {
        switch (average / 10) {
            case 10:
            case 9:
                return 4;
            case 8:
                return 3;
            case 7:
                return 2;
            case 6:
                return 1;
            default:
                return 0;
    }
    }
```
