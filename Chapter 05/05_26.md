# Exercsie 5.26: Towers of Hanoi

**Write a program to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem. Use a recursive function with four parameters:**
- a)**The number of disks to be moved**
- b)**The peg on which these disks are initially threaded**
- c)**The peg to which this stack of disks is to be moved**
- d)**The peg to be used as a temporary holding area**

**Display the precise instructions for moving the disks from the starting peg to the destination peg. To move a stack of three disks from peg 1 to peg 3, the program displays the following moves:**

```txt
1 → 3
1 → 2
3 → 2
1 → 3
2 → 1
2 → 3
1 → 3
```
