# Exercise 5.17: Prime Numbers

**a) Write a function that determines whether a number is prime.**
**b) Use this function in a program that determines and prints all the prime numbers between 2 and 10,000. How many of these numbers do you have to test before being sure youâ€™ve found all the primes?**
**c) Initially, you might think that n/2 is the upper limit for which you must test to see whether a number is prime, but you need only go as high as the square root of n. Why? Rewrite the program, and run it both ways. Estimate the performance improvement.**

- a) 
```cpp
bool isPrime(int n) {
    for(int i = 2;i < n/2; ++i) {
        if(n % i == 0)
            return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```

- b)
```cpp
    bool isPrime(int n) {
        for(int i = 2;i < n/2; ++i) {
            if(n % i == 0)
                return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
```
    n/2 times

- c) It is because if n is divisible by a number greater than its square root, it must also be divisible by a number smaller than its square root.
