# Exercise 5.22: Guess-the-Number Game

**Write a program that plays the game of “guess the number” as follows: Your program chooses the number to be guessed by selecting an integer at random in the range 1 to 1000. The program then displays the following:**

```txt
I have a number between 1 and 1000.
Can you guess my number?
Please type your first guess.
```

**The player then types a first guess. The program responds with one of the following**

```txt
1. Excellent! You guessed the number!
   Would you like to play again (y or n)?
2. Too low. Try again.
3. Too high. Try again.
```

**If the player’s guess is incorrect, your program should loop until the player finally gets the number right. Your program should keep telling the player `Too high` or `Too low` to help the player “zero in” on the correct answer.**
