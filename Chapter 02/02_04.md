# Exercise 2.4

**Write a single C++ statement to accomplish each of the following (assume that neither using declarations nor a using directive has been used):**

- a) Declare the variables `c`, `thisIsAVariable`, `q76354` and `number` to be of type `int`(in one statement) and initialize each to 0. 
```cpp
    int c{0}, thisIsAVariable{0}, q76354{0}, number{0};
```

- b) Prompt the user to enter an integer. End your prompting message with a colon `:` followed by a space, and leave the cursor positioned after the space

```cpp
    std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
```

- c) Read an integer from the user at the keyboard and store it in `int` variable age.
```cpp
    std::cin >> age;
```

- d) If the variable number is not equal to 7, print "The variable number is not equal to 7".
```cpp
    number != 7? std::cout << "he variable number is not
equal to 7"
```

- e) Print "This is a C++ program" on one line.
```cpp
    std::cout << "This is a C++ program";
```

- f) Print "This is a C++ program" on two lines. End the first line with C++. 
```cpp
    std::cout << "This is a C++ \nprogram";
```

- g) Print "This is a C++ program" with each word on a separate line.
```cpp
    std::cout << "This\nis\na\nC++\nprogram";
```

- h) Print "Enter two numbers".
```cpp
    std::cout << "Enter two numbers";
```

- i) Assign the product of variables `b` and `c` to variable `a`.
```cpp
    a = b * c;
```

- j) State that a program performs a payroll calculation (i.e., use text that helps to document a program).
```cpp
   // program performs a payroll calculation
```

- k) Input three integer values from the keyboard into integer variables `a`, `b` and `c`. 
```cpp
   std::cin >> a >> b >> c;
```
