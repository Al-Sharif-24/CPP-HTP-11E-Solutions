# Exercise 2.10

**Write a statement (or comment) to accomplish each of the following (assume that using declarations have been used for `cin`, `cout` and `endl`):**

- a) Document that a program calculates the product of three integers
```cpp
// program to calculate the product of three integers
```

- b) Declare the variables x, y, z and result to be of type `int` (in separate statements) and initialize each to 0.
```cpp
int x = 0;
int y = 0;
int z = 0;
int result = 0;
```

- c) Prompt the user to enter three integers.
```cpp
cout << "Enter three integers" << endl;
```

- d) Read three integers from the keyboard and store them in variables `x`, `y` and `z`.
```cpp
cin >> x >> y >> z;
```

- e) Compute the product of the three integers in variables `x`, `y` and `z`, and assign
the result to the variable `result`.
```cpp
result = x * y * z;
```

- f) Print "The product is " followed by the value of the variable `result`.
```cpp
cout << "The product is " << result << endl;
```
