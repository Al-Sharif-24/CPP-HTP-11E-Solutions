# Exercise 2.8

**Given the algebraic equation `y = ax 3 + 7`, which of the following, if any, are correct C++ statements for this equation?**

- a) `y = a * x * x * x + 7;`
- b) `y = a * x * x * (x + 7);`
- c) `y = (a * x) * x * (x + 7);`
- d) `y = (a * x) * x * x + 7;`
- e) `y = a * (x * x * x) + 7;`
- f) `y = a * x * (x * x + 7);`

statement `a`, `d` and `e` are the correct statements for algebraic equation y = ax<sup>3</sup> + 7
