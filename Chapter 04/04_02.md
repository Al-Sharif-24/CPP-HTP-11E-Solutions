# Exercise 4.2: Compare Two Terms

**Compare and contrast the `while` and `for` iteration statements.**

- *while*

The `while` statement contains only a condition, which is checked so as to determine if the loop needs to continue.

```cpp
while(condition) {
    // code
}
```

The `while` loop repeats a block of code while the condition is true

- *for*

The `for` statement has three parts t0 it:
a. Initialisation
b. Condition
c. Increment/Decrement

All three of them are optional

```cpp
for(initialisation; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code
}
```
