# Exercise 4.24: "The Twelve Days of Christmas” Song

**Find the lyrics to the song “The Twelve Days of Christmas” online, then write an application using iteration and `switch` to print the song. One `switch` statement should be used to print the day (“first,” “second,” and so on). A separate `switch`statement should be used to print the remainder of each verse**
