# Exercise 4.18: De Morgan's Law

**Use De Morganâ€™s laws to write equivalent expressions for each of the following, then write an application to show that both the original expression and the new expression in each case produce the same value:**

- a) !(x < 5) && !(y >= 7)
`!(x < 5) && !(y >= 7)` = `!((x < 5) || y >= 7)`

- b) !(a == b) || !(g != 5)
`!(a == b) || !(g != 5)` = `!((a == b) && !(g != 5))`

- c) !((x <= 8) && (y > 4))
`!((x <= 8) && (y > 4))` = `!(x <= 8) || !(y > 4)`

- d) !((i > 4) || (j <= 6))
`!((i > 4) || (j <= 6))` = `!(i > 4) && !(j <= 6)`
