# Solution to Exercise 04.23 (Replacing continue with a structured Equivalent)

-   To replace continue with a structured equivalent, we need to:

    1.  Identify the condition that leads to the continue statement.
    2.  Negate this condition.
    3.  Wrap the remaining code in the loop body (after the continue) inside an if statement with the negated condition.
