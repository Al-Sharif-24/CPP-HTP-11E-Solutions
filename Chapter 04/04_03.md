# Solutions to Exercise 4.3 (Discuss a situation)

-   Because `do-while` loop is used when the loop body must execute at least once.

-   Consider a situation where you have to show the user a menu then if he enters a number as input and if this input is 0 program ends.

```cpp
int input;

do
{
    cout << "1: For time."
         << "\n2: For date."
         << "\n0: For exit."
         << "\n\n Enter a number: ";
    cin >> input;

    if (input == 1)
    {
        // show time
    }
    else if (input == 2)
    {
        // show date
    }

} while (input != 0);
```

```cpp
cout << "1: For time."
     << "\n2: For date."
     << "\n0: For exit."
     << "\n\n Enter a number: ";
int input;
cin >> input;
while (input != 0)
{
    if (input == 1)
    {
        //show time
    }
    else if (input == 2)
    {
        // show date
    }
    cout << "1: For time."
         << "\n2: For date."
         << "\n0: For exit."
         << "\n\n Enter a number: ";
    cin >> input;
}
```

-   As it's obvious the do-while code is more concise and doesn't have repeated code.
