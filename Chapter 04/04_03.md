# Exercise 4.3: Discuss a Situation

**Discuss a situation in which it would be more appropriate to use a `do...while` statement than a `while` statement. Explain why**

- The `do...while` loop is usually used when you want to run the loop atleast once.

- One such situation in which `do...while` is used, rather than a `while` loop is when you want to run a game loop and check the condition if the game has ended.

```cpp
do {
    // code inside the game loop
} while(!gameover)
```
