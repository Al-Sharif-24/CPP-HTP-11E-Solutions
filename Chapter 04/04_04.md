# Exercsie 4.4: Compare Two Terms

**Compare and Contrast the `break` and `continue` statements.**

1. `break`
The `break` statement is used when you want to exit out of an infinite loop, or exit out early from a loop.

```cpp
for(int i{0}; i < 10; ++i) {
    if(i == 5)
        break;

    std::cout << i << " ";
}
```

**OUTPUT**
```txt
1 2 3 4
```
2. `continue`
The `continue` statement is used when you want to skip an iteration of the loop and continue the loop from the start.

```cpp
for(int i{0}; i < 10; ++i) {
    if(i == 5)
        continue;

    std::cout << i << " ";
}
```

**OUTPUT**
```txt
1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9
```
