# Solutions to Exercise 4.4 (Compare break and continue)

## Break

-   Break can be used with `while`, `do-while`, `for`, `switch case`.

-   Break exits immediately from the control statement, executing the its first statement after the its control statement.

## Continue

-   Continue can be used with `while`, `do-while`, `for`.

-   Continue skips the current iteration and continues to the next iteration.

-   In `while`, `do-while` it goes immediately to the loop continuation condition.

-   In `for` it increments first and then execute the loop continuation condition.
