# Exercise 4.5: Whatâ€™s Wrong with This Code?

**Find the error(s), if any, in each of the following:**

-  a)
```cpp
For (int x{100}, x >= 1, ++x) {
    cout << x << ' ';
}
```

The `For` statement starts with a capital, and it the header for the for loop has commas instead of semicolons.

**The Correct Code**
```cpp
for (int x{100}; x >= 1; ++x) {
    cout << x << ' ';
}
```

- b)
```cpp
switch (value % 2) {
    case 0:
        cout << "Even integer\n";
    case 1:
        cout << "Odd integer\n";
}
```

The `break` statement is missing in `case 0` which may lead it to fallthrough to the `case 1`

**The Correct C**
```cpp
switch (value % 2) {
    case 0:
        cout << "Even integer\n";
    break;
    case 1:
        cout << "Odd integer\n";
}
```

- c) 
```cpp
for (int x{19}; x >= 1; x += 2) {
    cout << x << ' ';
}
```

The operator used here is `+=` which will increment and run an infinite loop, whereas the correcto operator that needs to be used is `-=`.

**The Correct Code**
```cpp
for (int x{19}; x >= 1; x -= 2) {
    cout << x << ' ';
}
```

4.
```cpp
int counter{2};
do {
    cout << counter << ' ';
    counter += 2;
} While (counter < 100);
```

The `while` statment starts with a capital 'W', and the condition is also incorrect as it won't print the 100th integer.

**The Correct Code**
```cpp
int counter{2};
do {
    cout << counter << ' ';
    counter += 2;
} while (counter <= 100);
```
