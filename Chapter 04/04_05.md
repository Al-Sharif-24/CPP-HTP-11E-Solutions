# Solutions to Exercise 4.5 (What's Wrong with This Code?)

## a)

-   **Syntax Error**: `For` is not a keyword in C++, instead use `for`.
-   **Syntax Error**: used commas instead of semicolons in the `for` statement's header.
-   **Logic Error**: The value of `x` is greater than `1` and it keep getting incremented which leads to an **infinite loop**.

```cpp
// changed For to for and changed commas to semicolons
for (int x{100}; x >= 1; --x) { // changed increment to decrement
    // This way it prints number from 100 to 1 descending
    cout << x << ' ';

}
```

## b)

-   **Logic Error**: missed break statement in `case 0` which leads to printing both `case 0` and `case 1` if the number is even.

```cpp
switch (value % 2)
{
case 0:
    cout << "Even integer\n";
    break;
case 1:
    cout << "Odd integer\n";
}
```

## c)

-   **Logic Error**: The value of `x` is greater than `1` and it keep getting incremented which leads to an **infinite loop**.

```cpp
for (int x{19}; x >= 1; x -= 2) { // changed += to -=
    cout << x << ' ';
}
```

## d)

-   **Syntax Error**: `While` is not a c++ keyword instead use `while`.
-   **Logic Error**: Using strictly less than instead of less than or equal leads to omitting `100`.

```cpp
int counter{2};

do {
    cout << counter << ' ';
    counter +=2;
} while (counter <= 100);
```
