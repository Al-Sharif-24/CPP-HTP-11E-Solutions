# Exercise 4.9: Factorials

**Write an application that calculates the factorials of 1 through 20. Use type `long`. Display the results in tabular format. What difficulty might prevent you from calculating the factorial of 100?**

[C++ Program File](p04_p09.cpp)

`long` data type can only provide values upto a certain range, whereas the factorial of 100 is a very large number which the long can't store.
