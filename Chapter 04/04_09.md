# Solutions to Exercise 4.9 (Factorials)

-   [C++ Code File](e04_09.cpp)
-   The difficulty that might prevent from calculating the factorial of 100, is that the type `long` can't hold values as 100! which is 158-digit number, which is too large to be stored in a `long` variable.
-   We can use something like boost multiprecision library to calculate the factorial of 100.
